				<p>
					Nagar Palika or municipality is a urban local body that administers
					a city of population 100,000 or more, however there are exceptions
					to that as previously Nagar Palika were constituted in urban
					centers with population over 20,000 so all the urban bodies which
					were previously classified as&nbsp;<span>N</span><span>agar<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>P</span><span>alika</span>
					were reclassified as&nbsp;<span>N</span><span>agar<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>P</span><span>alika</span>
					even if their population was under 100,000. Under the Panchayati
					Raj system, it interacts directly with the state government, though
					it is administratively part of the district it is located in.
					Generally smaller district cities and bigger towns have a <span>N</span><span>agar<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>P</span><span>alika</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The members of the&nbsp;<span>N</span><span>agar<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>P</span><span>alika</span>
					are elected representatives for a term of five years. The town is
					divided into wards according to its population and representatives
					are elected from each ward and a chairman also elected by citizen
					of Nagar Palika. A chief officer, along with officers like an
					engineer, sanitary inspector, health officer and education officer
					who come from the state public service are appointed by the state
					government to control the administrative affairs of the <span>N</span><span>agar<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>P</span><span>alika</span>.
